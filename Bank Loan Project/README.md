# Banking Project: End-to-End Analysis
## Problem Statement
In order to monitor and assess a bank's lending activities and performance, I have created a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. 
This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. 
It will help the bank to make data-driven decisions, track loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform bank's lending strategies.

## About the Data
The dataset comprises information about bank loans sanctioned to customers. 
Key attributes include:

- Employment Length
- Grades and Subgrades (based on credit scores)
- Annual Income
- Purpose of Loan
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Loan Term
- Home Ownership Status

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer profiles and loan performance, forming the foundation for analysis.

## Analysis Approach
### Excel
1. Performed initial data cleaning, including handling missing values and standardizing column formats.
2. Added an extra column, Good Loan vs. Bad Loan, for easier segmentation during analysis.
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pivot tables to calculate KPIs for dashboard creation.
4. Designed a comprehensive Excel dashboard with KPIs and various visualizations, such as bar charts and line graphs, to explore customer-loan relationships.
### SQL
1. Imported cleaned data from Excel into SQL.
2. Standardized column datatypes for efficient query processing.
3. Rechecked and verified KPI calculations using SQL queries to ensure accuracy.
### Power BI
1. Imported data and created a Date Table to facilitate time-related analysis and enhance visualizations.
2. Added custom measures and calculated columns to support advanced analytics and dynamic visuals.
3. Built an interactive dashboard with slicers, filters, and dynamic visuals to explore KPIs and loan trends in depth.
### Tableau
1. Imported data and created measures, groups, and parameters to design user-interactive dashboards.
2. Created visually compelling dashboards with charts such as line graphs, bar charts, and heat maps for easy interpretation of loan-related trends.
## Conclusion
Good Loan Issuance: Approximately 90% of issued loans were classified as good loans, with less than 15% bad loans, indicating a healthy portfolio and supporting the bank's growth.
Comprehensive Analysis:
Analyzed loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts across various dimensions:
- Time: Monthly and quarterly trends.
- Demographics: Employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership status.
- Loan Attributes: Term period and region.

Created visuals that provide actionable insights into customer behavior and lending strategies which is attached below for reference.
