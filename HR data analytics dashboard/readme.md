The project involves creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard in Power BI to analyze HR data. 
The dashboard provides insights into key HR metrics, helping stakeholders understand employee trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Skills Used
- Measure Creation: Custom DAX measures for report-level analysis and actionable insights.
- Visual Design: Used various charts, cards, and tables for dynamic data representation.
- Interactivity: Implemented slicers for easy navigation and filtering of data in the dashboard.
## Dashboard Creation
### Data Preparation
- Imported the cleaned Excel file containing HR data into Power BI.
- Built a robust data model to support dynamic measures and visuals.

## Visuals and Insights
Added a variety of visuals to represent data effectively:
- Cards: Displayed KPIs like total employees, attrition count, and job satisfaction.

- Male Employees: 65% attrition rate.
- Female Employees: Below 40% attrition rate.
- Age Band 25-44: Represents 70% of total attrition.

### Interactivity
- Integrated a slicer for filtering data by Education allowing users to explore data dynamically.
## Conclusion
The analysis reveals critical insights into workforce trends and attrition dynamics:

- The organization has an overall attrition rate above 15%, which is significantly higher than the recommended rate of less than 10%.
- High attrition rates in key departments (R&D, Sales) and among specific demographics (age 25-44, males) indicate areas that require focused intervention.

Reducing the attrition rate below 10% is crucial to fostering sustainable growth and improving employee retention,
which directly impacts the company's performance and stability.
